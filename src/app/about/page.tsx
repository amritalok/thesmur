        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
          Welcome to our jewelry portfolio! This business is close to my heart because it represents the fusion of traditional
          craftsmanship and modern design. Every piece is a labor of love that celebrates heritage, creativity, and personal
          expression.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
          Our journey began with a passion for art and a desire to create unique pieces that empower individuals. We believe that
          jewelry is not just an accessory but a statement of who you are.
