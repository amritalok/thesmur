              At <em className="text-[var(--color-gold)] font-medium">The SMUR</em>, we believe that jewelry is more than just an
              accessory-it&apos;s a story, a memory, a reflection of the places that shape us. Founded with a passion for travel
              and cultural exploration, <em className="text-[var(--color-gold)] font-medium">The SMUR</em> brings a unique collection
              of jewelry inspired by the destinations <em>I have traveled to</em>. Each piece in our collection is personally
              curated, blending the beauty of different cultures with modern elegance. From the intricate craftsmanship of{' '}
              <em>Jaipur</em>, the romantic charm of <strong>Paris</strong>, the vibrant textures of <strong>Dubai souks</strong>,

        I started The SMUR as a software developer with a passion for travel and storytelling. 
        While I loved building digital experiences, I longed to create something more personal-something that connected my journeys with others in a tangible way. 
        Every place I visited left behind colors, stories, and emotions that I wanted to preserve, and that’s how <em className="text-[var(--color-gold)] font-medium">The SMUR</em>  was born- a travel-inspired jewelry brand that transforms moments into meaningful, anti-tarnish pieces you can wear every day.
But <em className="text-[var(--color-gold)] font-medium">The SMUR</em> is more than just a brand—it’s a tribute. The name itself is made from the initials of my parents and siblings who live in India. 
They are my roots, my strength, and the reason I am who I am today. Their constant love and inspiration fuel everything I do, even from miles away. 
From writing code to curating jewelry, the journey from software developer to entrepreneur has been full of challenges, but it is also been the most fulfilling.
 I want people to know that behind every piece is not just a memory of a place, but a legacy of love, resilience, and family.
